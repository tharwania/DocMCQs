She has a high temperature and tachycardia.  One of the more common inpatient regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease is IV ceftriaxone 2g daily plus IV doxycycline 100mg twice daily (oral doxycycline may be used if tolerated) followed by oral doxycycline 100mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily for a total of 14 days. Intravenous therapy should be continued until 24 hours after clinical improvement and then switched to oral.   Although it's stated that we use intravenous doxycycline as part of the antibiotic regimen, this is usually not the case as Intravenous doxycycline is not currently licensed in the UK.  Whist taking triple swabs is appropriate, we should not wait for results before commencing antibiotics. Antibiotics should be commenced immediately as to avoid complications such as tubo-ovarian abscess or tubal damage leading to infertility. Once culture and sensitivity results are available, change of antibiotics may be required. The change usually involves ofloxacin as Gonorrhoea is increasingly resistant to fluoroquinolone in the UK.OPTIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF PIDOutpatient management of PIDIM ceftriaxone stat plus oral doxycycline and oral metronidazole for 14 days; orOfloxacin and metronidazole orally for 14 days  Inpatient management of PIDIV ceftriaxone and IV doxycycline followed by oral doxycycline and oral metronidazole for 14 days; orIV ofloxacin and IV metronidazole for a total of 14 daysPelvic inflammatory disease (PID)",

These fractures can injure the radial nerve, which courses in a spiral groove right around the posterior aspect of that bone. The management of humeral shaft fracture is not commonly asked in exam but you may want to know it for your own knowledge:Nonoperative management is adequate for more than 90% of these fractures. Hanging arm cast or coaptation splint are used, and the nerve function returns eventually. Surgical management may sometimes be needed but are uncommon.

       "explanation":"The most significant point to highlight in this case is his potassium levels. His potassium levels are high enough to cause a life-threatening arrhythmia. The high levels of potassium could be due to many reasons but it is likely that he is suffering from acute kidney injury due to heart failure causing low blood volumes.The hyperkalaemia needs to be addressed first to prevent cardiac arrest.Shifting potassium intracellularly is a useful holding measure in life threatening hyperkalaemia. This can be done quickly by administering Insulin ActrapidÂ® 10 units in 50 mL of Glucose 50% intravenously over 30 minutes via a volumetric pump. Insulin stimulates cellular uptake of potassium, so it drops serum potassium levels rapidly, and glucose is given with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. This would reduce serum potassium levels by 0.65 - 1.0mmol/L but the reduction only last for about an hour. This is usually followed by monitoring blood glucose after 15 minutes, 30 minutes and then hourly for up to 6 hours as there is a risk of late hypoglycaemia. Again this regimen would differ depending on your local hospital guideline for hyperkalaemia. Just remember that capillary blood glucose needs to be checked before, during and after insulin-glucose infusion.Other methods that can be used to treat life threatening hyperkalaemia include:10-20 mg nebulised salbutamol - this reduces serum potassium (0.5-1.0 mmol/L) in 15-30 minutes and lasts for two hoursIt is also important to check potassium 30 minutes afterwards and if there is a good response, check U&E 1-2 hours later.It is important to remember that shifting potassium intracellularly to treat life threatening hyperkalaemia does not reduce total body potassium, and after two to six hours, there is an efflux of potassium back out into the extracellular space resulting in serum levels as high or sometimes even higher than at the outset. Therefore, any of the steps mentioned must be combined with attempting to reduce total body potassium. This can be done by:Avoiding medications which can raise potassiumPromote urinary potassium loss Intravenous normal saline as long as the patient is not significantly overloaded (In this stem, you would not be giving IV fluids as he has heart failure and is clearly fluid overloaded given his clinical features of crackles at both lung bases and sacral oedema on palpation)If well hydrated consider starting or increasing the dose of a loop diuretic.Remove excess potassiumCalcium ResoniumÂ® has a slow onset of action (at least 2-6 hours) (This is the reason it is not the answer in this question. The action to correct hyperkalaemia is too slow. Calcium ResoniumÂ® has no role in an acute situation)DialysisThis is useful if all the above measures have been done and the patient still has high serum potassiumNote: Dialysis is also likely to be needed if potassium is very high ( >7.5 mmol/L) or patient is oligo or anuric. In this question, if dialysis was present, it would be a better option to pick rather than insulin-glucose infusion because this patient is having acute renal failure and is anuric. If haemodialysis is performed within 15-30 minutes then treatments to move potassium into cells are unlikely to be helpful and may make potassium removal on dialysis more difficult.Sodium bicarbonate may be useful in the setting of resistant hyperkalaemia with acidosis. It should only be considered if pH is < 7.2. The use of sodium bicarbonate is controversial in patients with acidosis and there is still insufficient evidence to justify routine use. It is therefore likely to always be the WRONG answer in the PLAB part 1 test in the context of hyperkalaemia.If intravenous calcium gluconate was in one of the options, that would also be a correct answer because it is needed to stabilise the cardiac membrane to prevent arrhythmias. Intravenous calcium has rapid effects, resulting in improvement of ECG abnormalities within minutes of administration. Reference:https://patient.info/doctor/hyperkalaemia-in-adultsHyperkalaemia",

       "explanation":"This is a typical presentation of a scaphoid fracture.It is a very debatable question. The answers C and D both may seem right. But the more appropriate answer of the two would be C.First we need to understand Scaphoid fractures.A very typical scenario is a young man who falls on his outstretched hand with forced dorsiflexion. X-rays are usually negative but if repeated in 2 weeks become positive.They are also infamous because of a high rate of nonunion. Signs: Tender in anatomical snuff box and over scaphoid tubercle, pain on axial compression of the thumb, and on ulnar deviation of the pronated wrist, or supination against resistance. If initial X-rays are negative, cast and re-x-ray in 2 weeks.Unfortunately, for this question, re-x ray was not an option. So many candidates would have picked âD. Scaphoid cast for 6 weeksâ . We asked orthopaedic registrars regarding this question, and most would agree that âC. Immobilization of the wrist and review in 2 weeksâ would be a better answer because you should not cast for 6 weeks without knowing if there is actually a fracture. Thus immobilize for 2 weeks, and review (and obtain X-rays). If fracture is seen after 2 weeks, then cast for another 4 more weeks.Reference:http://patient.info/doctor/wrist-fractures",

Testicular torsionKey features of testicular torsion include:Severe, sudden onset testicular painTypically affects adolescents and young malesOn examination testis is tender and pain not eased by elevationRemember: In testicular torsion, lifting the testis up over the symphysis increases pain, whereas in epididymitis this usually relieves pain. Urgent surgery is indicatedManagement:Urgent exploratory surgery is needed to prevent ischaemia of the testicleColour Doppler USS (reduced arterial blood flow in the testicular artery) and radionuclide scanning (decreased radioisotope uptake) can be used to diagnose testicular torsion, but in many hospitals, these tests are not readily available and the diagnosis is based on symptoms and signs. Scrotal exploration should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Delay in relieving the twisted testis results in permanent ischaemic damage to the testis, causing atrophy.This is a very high yield question and in most cases if you suspect testicular torsion the answer would be exploratory surgery (or urgent surgery).REMEMBER: if clinical suspicion is high, surgical intervention should not be delayed for the sake of further investigation!Reference:http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/778086-treatmenthttp://patient.info/doctor/torsion-of-the-testis-pro",
